Metrics

Every resource method can be annotated with @Timed, @Metered, and @ExceptionMetered. Dropwizard augments Jersey to automatically record runtime information about your resource methods.

    @Timed measures the duration of requests to a resource
    @Metered measures the rate at which the resource is accessed
    @ExceptionMetered measures how often exceptions occur processing the resource

--

api: Representations. Request and response bodies.
= json pojo request / reponse

core:
= domain objects, not used by api

resources: Resources
= manages api
